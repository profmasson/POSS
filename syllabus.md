# Course Description

This is a undergrad/graduate course introducing the principles & practices of open source software development & communities of practice: history, intellectual property rights, economics & business models, development models, and community standards. The course begins with a historical study of the emergence and maturity of open source software from a variety of influences: the computer industry, thought leaders, and cultural movements. From there the course then covers copyright/patents,/trademarks/licensing and basic concepts of contracts. The impact of open source development and adoption on economics & various business models, in particular clarifying the apparent contradiction between free flow of information and the funding & compensation of participants, are explored. The operational and organizational aspects of open source communities are covered to help understand the motivations that drive authentic participation: community, collaboration, contribution and co-creation. Throughout the course, hands-on activities using open source technologies are performed in order to develop skills on the practices of participation.

## Course Goals

Students will come to understand open source as a licensing model for software that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process. Students will assess and understand the promise of open source as an approach for development and distribution, leading to higher quality, better reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end to vendor lock-in. Students will be able to abstract and extend open source ideals on development and distribution in order to apply those principles and practices to other artifacts and disciplines.

* Assess the opportunities and constraints for participation in open source software projects through evidence of practice within the community.
* Promote participation in open source projects through communication, transparency, self-organization, collaboration, evidence and merit.
* Seek out solutions for open source projects based on simplicity, emergence, incremental and iterative design and feedback.

## Coordination

In this course, we use [$SHARED_PLATFORM], an open source platform for information dissemination, collaboration, development and review. All information related to the course is through [$SHARED_PLATFORM]. This includes: assignments, announcements, forum discussion, evaluations, grades, etc.  

## Readings

Readings are assigned from the following books.  
There is no need to buy any of the books, all the relevant sections are freely available online.  
Direct links are made available in [$SHARED_PLATFORM].  

[The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musing on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001087.do)  
Eric S. Raymond; O’Reilly (January, 2001).  

[Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project](http://producingoss.com/)  
Karl Fogel; Publisher: O’Reilly (October, 2005).  

Other readings may be added as the semester progresses.  

## Additional Materials  

Throughout the course students participate in a current open project. Relevant accounts (email lists, wiki, etc.) are needed (or need to be created) by all students. Students may choose to create a unique identity specific to the course in order to protect privacy. These private accounts will need to be shared with the instructor and classmates.

The course uses the open source platform [$SHARED_PLATFORM] as the class management system. [$SHARED_PLATFORM] accounts need to be created by all students.

## Instructional Methodology: Team-based learning

    This course is developed using "[Team-Based Learning](http://www.teambasedlearning.org/definition/)," with support from [The Institute for Teaching, Learning and Academic Leadership](http://www.itlal.org/) (ITLAL)

The majority of work in this class is performed in teams. On the first day of the course, students are assigned to a team that works together throughout the semester. Course grades are influenced by team performance on all class assignments. The class is structured in a collaborative environment, where all students share the accomplishments and frustrations of peer-to-peer participation, and receive the appropriate credit for their efforts. An student's contributions to team work is assessed by his or her teammates during the semester, the instructors, as well as outcomes achieved throughout team-based activities.

A typical class session unfolds in the following steps:

**Preparation**: Students complete specified readings before the class. Reading assignments will be posted on a [$SHARED_PLATFORM]. All reading assignments must be completed before the next class in order to actively participate with your team and across teams in the class.  
**Readiness Assessment Tests (RATs)**: During this course students are given several Readiness Assessment Tests. These tests are similar to quizzes, but with several important distinctions. There are three components to them, as well as a flexible method of answering the items on the test:
- An individual part (iRAT)--each student will answer the questions on the test individually.
- A team part (tRAT)-- after completing the individual component, you will work in your teams to come up with a group answer to the test.
-- Scoring for the iRAT: 10 questions, 5pt.s each for a total of 50pt.s

Scoring for the tRAT: 10 questions, 10pt.s each for a total of 100pt.s,
            Correct answer select on first try, 10pt.s
            Correct answer select on second try, 7pt.s
            Correct answer select on third try, 4pt.s
            Correct answer select on fourth try, 1pt.
            Appeals--if your team believes the answer selected by the instructor is not correct and/or you believe the question was ambiguous, you may prepare an appeal; it must be in writing and given to the instructor. If it is decided that your appeal has sufficient merit, credit will be restored to the group part (and consequently to each member of the group).
    In-Class Activities: Discussion topics, activities and projects will be assigned to your team, based on the common reading material and building on previous discussions. Most of the questions to be discussed in class do not have a right answer, rather a best answer, informed by discussions within the team, individual perspectives, and the content of the readings and other homework. These class activities are a mechanism for examining the many arguments that can weight in a discussion. For example, a typical question could be: “What should be the ideal duration of copyright for software, as opposed to books, and why ?”
        Participation:
            Active participation will be the basis for evaluating in-class activities.
            After having discussed the topics inside each team, the conversation will be extended to cover the entire class.
            Peer Evaluation: You will have the chance to provide feedback to your team members on a regular basis throughout the semester. This will help everyone improve their skills and value peer-assessment practices. Specific details on peer-evaluation will be provided at the beginning of every class.
            
    *$SHARED_PLATFORM may be a wiki, discussion forum, Github/Gitlab, GoogleDocs, etc.

Grading

There will be a variety of grades awarded throughout the term for assignments and participation.

    Four Individual RATs, 50 points each = 200 points
    Four Team RATs, 100 points each = 400 points
    Ten homework assignments, 30 points each = 300 points
    Individual final grade (individual participation) = 200 points
    Team final grade = 400 points
    Attendance, 20 points per class (you may miss one class) = 240 points 
    Extra credit, perfect attendance = 60
    Total = 1740 possible points

Final grades will be awarded based on the following scale, as a percentage of all points possible throughout the course:

    A, ≥ 90%
    B, ≥ 80% but < 90%;
    C, ≥ 70% but < 80%;
    D, ≥ 60% but < 70%;
    F, < 60%

Due Dates

All assignments must delivered in person or via XWiki by midnight on the final day of examinations (December 20, 2016).
Course Policies

Attendance:

    In-class activities constitute an important part of the course grade. It is not possible to maintain a passing average without consistent attendance.
    Missing class means you earn an automatic zero for the activities or assignments missed.

Tardiness:

    Missing an assignment or activity that happened before you arrive or after you leave also earns a zero. If you know that it will be difficult for you to consistently get to class on time and stay for the entire period, you should take this course at a time that better fits your schedule. Being late/leaving early frequently will guarantee a low grade for the course.

Cell phones & laptops:
 Laptops and other personal devices will be helpful for accessing reading assignments or other in-class activities and are recommended for use during class meetings. Out of respect for your classmates and the in-class activities, please refrain from undertaking activities that could be distracting to your classmates or the course.

Time Management:
 For every credit hour that a course meets, students should expect to work 3 additional hours outside of class every week. For this three-credit course, you should expect to work 9 hours (3 x 3 = 9) outside of class every week. Manage your time effectively to complete readings, assignments, and projects. In preparation for every class you will be required to do a reading and/or homework assignment. Typically this will involve one or two assigned readings and a small project. While many of the readings and assignments will prepare you for the following in-class activities, as the content covered is foundational, you will be expected to draw on this work throughout the course and for future assignments.

Withdrawal from the course:
 The drop date for the semester is posted on the Drop Dates Calendar. This lists the last date you can drop a course and receive a 'W'. It is your responsibility to take action by this date if you wish to drop the course. In particular, grades of "incomplete" will not be awarded to students because they missed the drop deadline.

Incompletes:
 As per the Undergraduate Bulletin, the grade of Incomplete (I) will be given "only when the student has nearly completed the course requirements but because of circumstances beyond the student's control the work is not completed." A student granted an incomplete will make an agreement specifying what material must be made up, and a date for its completion. The incomplete will be converted to a normal grade on the agreed upon completion date based upon whatever material is submitted by that time. Important: Incompletes will not be given to students who have not fulfilled their class work obligations, and who, at the end of the semester, are looking to avoid failing the course. This is asking for special treatment.

Academic Integrity:
 It is every student’s responsibility to become familiar with the standards of academic integrity at the University. Claims of ignorance, of unintentional error, or of academic or personal pressures are not sufficient reasons for violations of academic integrity. See http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html

Responsible Use of Information Technology:
 Students are required to read the University at Albany Policy for the Responsible Use of Information Technology available at the ITS Web Site: http://www.albany.edu/its/policies_responsible_use_of_IT.htm

Available Support Services:
 Reasonable accommodation will be provided for students with documented physical, sensory, cognitive, learning and psychiatric disorders. If you believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class, please notify the Director of Disability Resource Center (Campus Center 137, 442-5490). That office will provide the course instructor with verification of your disability, and will recommend appropriate accommodations. In general, it is the student's responsibility to contact the instructor at least one week before the relevant assignment to make arrangements.

Classwork

    Present findings and evidence (if any) of fauxpen source and/or open-washing of various projects.
    Introduction and discussion of final project:
    Develop an open source business plan and project community for "Mutiny."
    Throughout the course we have been documenting how the lessons learned related to open source principles and practices could have been applied to the fictional computer company, Cardiff Electric, in the AMC Series, "Halt & Catch Fire." The final project for this course will continue this exercise by asking the class--as a team--to design and propose an "open source community" in support of Cameron Howe's start-up "Mutiny."
    The assignment will be graded based on the quality of the proposed design. A high quality proposal will include:

        A strategic plan for the Mutiny open source community;
        An inventory of tools which will support the Mutiny open source community, and aligns with the strategic plan;
        Techniques describing how the Mutiny open source community will engage with one another (individuals, groups, users, developers, public, other businesses, etc.) using the infrastructure and tools prescribed to achieve the strategic goals;
        Job descriptions (i.e. roles and responsibilities) and how each position will use (e.g. their techniques and desired outcomes) for any tools prescribed, and
        Key performance indicators for each job, tool and technique that will guide the success of "Mutiny."Final Project Grading
        Project Grade: Grades will be based on the total grade awarded for the group writing assignment. Once the final project is graded (based on the above), this will become the highest grade possible for any individual student. The higher the group project, the higher possible grade for individual students. For example, if the final project is awarded a 90%, no student can receive a higher grade than 90%.
        Individual Grades for Final Project: Individual grades will be based on your individual involvement with the development of the final project. The individual will be graded based on the final grade of the proposed design and the student's engagement and contributions. Engagement and contributions include:
            Consistent participation in the review of the work, recognized through communications with classmates, submission of issues to others, requests for support from others, assignment of tasks to others, completion of tasks/requests from others. 
            Actively contributing to the document, recognized by original work submitted and the quality of those submissions.
            Modifications of the work, recognized by the level of activity undertaken in editing, extending, building upon, adding clarity around others' work. 
            Engagement of the community, as recognized by the level of activity generated from an original contribution.
            Adherence to best practices in authoring, e.g. commenting on edits, "TLDR" in requests/comments, etc.
