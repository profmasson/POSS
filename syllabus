# Course Description

This is a undergrad/graduate course introducing the principles & practices of open source software development & communities of practice: history, intellectual property rights, economics & business models, development models, and community standards. The course begins with a historical study of the emergence and maturity of open source software from a variety of influences: the computer industry, thought leaders, and cultural movements. From there the course then covers copyright/patents,/trademarks/licensing and basic concepts of contracts. The impact of open source development and adoption on economics & various business models, in particular clarifying the apparent contradiction between free flow of information and the funding & compensation of participants, will be explored. The operational and organizational aspects of open source communities are covered to help understand the motivations that drive authentic participation: community, collaboration, contribution and co-creation. Throughout the course, hands-on activities using open source technologies are performed in order to develop skills on the practices of participation.
